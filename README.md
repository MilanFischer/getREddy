R codes enabling to read ghg files from the [LICOR eddy covariance systems](https://www.licor.com/env/products/eddy_covariance/). Functions for checking raw data time series, analyzing  (co)spectra, applying wavelet filtering or standard procedures like spike removal are provided. Further options include compiling the modified data back to ghgh files that can be used for flux calculation by EddyPro.
